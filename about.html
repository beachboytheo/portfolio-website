  <h1>All About Steve</h1>

  <p>I am a UX/UI Designer working to improve my front end coding skills to someday become a unicorn.
    By that I am referring to the mythical and much coveted UX/UI designer with an advanced and adaptive skill range.
    <br>(aka: outstanding skills in user experience design, user interface design, rapid prototyping, and front end development.)</p>

  <br>
  <p>I love working in the field of UX/UI Design because I am genuinely interested in understanding how people interact with different products. Ultimately, my goal
    is to design beautiful interactions that provide seamless experiences to help people complete their objectives.</p>
